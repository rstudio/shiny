\description{
  Functions for creating fixed page layouts. A fixed layout
  consists of rows which in turn include columns. Rows
  exist for the purpose of making sure their elements
  appear on the same line (if the browser has adequate
  width). Columns exist for the purpose of defining how
  much horizontal space within a 12-unit wide grid it's
  elements should occupy. Fixed pages limit their width to
  940 pixels.
}
\details{
  To create a fixed page use the \code{fixedPage} function
  and include instances of \code{fixedRow} and
  \code{\link{column}} within it. Note that unlike
  \code{\link{fluidPage}}, fixed pages cannot make use of
  higher-level layout functions like \code{sidebarLayout},
  rather, all layout must be done with \code{fixedRow} and
  \code{column}.

  \href{http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem}{fixed
  grid system} for additional details.
