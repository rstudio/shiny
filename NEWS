shiny 0.8.0.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: Added a `host` parameter to runApp() and runExample(),
  which defaults to the shiny.host option if it is non-NULL, or "127.0.0.1"
  otherwise. This means that by default, Shiny applications can only be
  accessed on the same machine from which they are served. To allow other
  clients to connect, as in previous versions of Shiny, use "0.0.0.0"
  (or the IP address of one of your network interfaces, if you care to be
  explicit about it).

* Upgraded to Bootstrap 2.3.2 and jQuery 1.10.2.

* Make `tags$head()` and `singleton()` behave correctly when used with
  `renderUI()` and `uiOutput()`. Previously, "hoisting content to the head"
  and "only rendering items a single time" were features that worked only
  when the page was initially loading, not in dynamic rendering.

* Files are now sourced with the `keep.source` option, to help with debugging
  and profiling.

* Support user-defined input parsers for data coming in from JavaScript using 
  the parseShinyInput method.

* Fixed the bug #299: renderDataTable() can deal with 0-row data frames now.
  (reported by Harlan Harris)

* Added `navbarPage()` and `navbarMenu()` functions to create applications
  with multiple top level panels.

* Added `navlistPanel()` function to create layouts with a a bootstrap
  navlist on the left and tabPanels on the right

* Added `type` parameter to `tabsetPanel()` to enable the use of pill 
  style tabs in addition to the standard ones.

* Added `position` paramter to `tabsetPanel()` to enable positioning of tabs
  above, below, left, or right of tab content.

* Added `fluidPage()` and `fixedPage()` functions as well as related row and
column layout functions for creating arbitrary bootstrap grid layouts.

* Added `hr()` builder function for creating horizontal rules.

* Automatically concatenate duplicate attributes in tag definitions

* Added `responsive` parameter to page building functions for opting-out of
bootstrap responsive css.

* Added `theme` parameter to page building functions for specifying alternate
bootstrap css styles.

* Added `icon()` function for embedding icons from the 
[http://fontawesome.io/](font awesome) icon library 

* Added `makeReactiveBinding` function to turn a "regular" variable into a
  reactive one (i.e. reading the variable makes the current reactive context
  dependent on it, and setting the variable is a source of reactivity).


shiny 0.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Debug hooks are registered on all user-provided functions and (reactive)
  expressions (e.g., in renderPlot()), which makes it possible to set
  breakpoints in these functions using the latest version of the RStudio
  IDE, and the RStudio visual debugging tools can be used to debug Shiny
  apps. Internally, the registration is done via installExprFunction(),
  which is a new function introduced in this version to replace
  exprToFunction() so that the registration can be automatically done.

* Added a new function renderDataTable() to display tables using the
  JavaScript library DataTables. It includes basic features like pagination,
  searching (global search or search by individual columns), sorting (by
  single or multiple columns). All these features are implemented on the R
  side; for example, we can use R regular expressions for searching.
  Besides, it also uses the Bootstrap CSS style. See the full
  documentation and examples in the tutorial:
  http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/#datatables

* Added a new option `shiny.error` which can take a function as an error
  handler. It is called when an error occurs in an app (in user-provided
  code), e.g., after we set options(shiny.error = recover), we can enter a
  specified environment in the call stack to debug our code after an error
  occurs.

* The argument `launch.browser` in runApp() can also be a function,
  which takes the URL of the shiny app as its input value.

* runApp() uses a random port between 3000 and 8000 instead of 8100 now. It
  will try up to 20 ports in case certain ports are not available.

* Fixed a bug for conditional panels: the value `input.id` in the condition
  was not correctly retrieved when the input widget had a type, such as
  numericInput(). (reported by Jason Bryer)

* Fixed two bugs in plotOutput(); clickId and hoverId did not give correct
  coordinates in Firefox, or when the axis limits of the plot were changed.
  (reported by Chris Warth and Greg D)

* The minimal required version for the httpuv package was increased to 1.2
  (on CRAN now).


shiny 0.7.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Stopped sending websocket subprotocol. This fixes a compatibility issue with
  Google Chrome 30.

* The `input` and `output` objects are now also accessible via `session$input`
  and `session$output`.

* Added click and hover events for static plots; see `?plotOutput` for details.

* Added optional logging of the execution states of a reactive program, and
  tools for visualizing the log data. To use, start a new R session and call
  `options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)`. Then launch a Shiny app and interact with it.
  Press Ctrl+F3 (or for Mac, Cmd+F3) in the browser to launch an interactive
  visualization of the reactivity that has occurred. See `?showReactLog` for
  more information.

* Added `includeScript()` and `includeCSS()` functions.

* Reactive expressions now have class="reactive" attribute. Also added
  `is.reactive()` and `is.reactivevalues()` functions.

* New `stopApp()` function, which stops an app and returns a value to the caller
  of `runApp()`.

* Added the `shiny.usecairo` option, which can be used to tell Shiny not to use
  Cairo for PNG output even when it is installed. (Defaults to `TRUE`.)

* Speed increases for `selectInput()` and `radioButtons()`, and their
  corresponding updater functions, for when they have many options.

* Added `tagSetChildren()` and `tagAppendChildren()` functions.

* The HTTP request object that created the websocket is now accessible from the
  `session` object, as `session$request`. This is a Rook-like request
  environment that can be used to access HTTP headers, among other things.
  (Note: When running in a Shiny Server environment, the request will reflect
  the proxy HTTP request that was made from the Shiny Server process to the R
  process, not the request that was made from the web browser to Shiny Server.)

* Fix `getComputedStyle` issue, for IE8 browser compatibility (#196). Note:
  Shiny Server is still required for IE8/9 compatibility.

* Add shiny.sharedSecret option, to require the HTTP header Shiny-Shared-Secret
  to be set to the given value.

shiny 0.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `tabsetPanel()` can be directed to start with a specific tab selected.

* Fix bug where multiple file uploads with 3 or more files result in incorrect
  data.

* Add `withTags()` function.

* Add dateInput and dateRangeInput.

* `shinyServer()` now takes an optional `session` argument, which is used for
  communication with the session object.

* Add functions to update values of existing inputs on a page, instead of
  replacing them entirely.

* Allow listening on domain sockets.

* Added `actionButton()` to Shiny.

* The server can now send custom JSON messages to the client. On the client
  side, functions can be registered to handle these messages.

* Callbacks can be registered to be called at the end of a client session.

* Add ability to set priority of observers and outputs. Each priority level
  gets its own queue.

* Fix bug where the presence of a submit button would prevent sending of
  metadata until the button was clicked.

* `reactiveTimer()` and `invalidateLater()` by default no longer invalidate
  reactive objects after the client session has closed.

* Shiny apps can be run without a server.r and ui.r file.

shiny 0.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Switch from websockets package for handling websocket connections to httpuv.

* New method for detecting hidden output objects. Instead of checking that
  height and width are 0, it checks that the object or any ancestor in the DOM
  has style display:none.

* Add `clientData` reactive values object, which carries information about the
  client. This includes the hidden status of output objects, height/width plot
  output objects, and the URL of the browser.

* Add `parseQueryString()` function.

* Add `renderImage()` function for sending arbitrary image files to the client,
  and its counterpart, `imageOutput()`.

* Add support for high-resolution (Retina) displays.

* Fix bug #55, where `renderTable()` would throw error with an empty data frame.

shiny 0.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix bug where width and height weren't passed along properly from
  `reactivePlot` to `renderPlot`.

* Fix bug where infinite recursion would happen when `reactivePlot` was passed
  a function for width or height.

shiny 0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added suspend/resume capability to observers.

* Output objects are automatically suspended when they are hidden on the user's
  web browser.

* `runGist()` accepts GitHub's new URL format, which includes the username.

* `reactive()` and `observe()` now take expressions instead of functions.

* `reactiveText()`, `reactivePlot()`, and so on, have been renamed to
  `renderText()`, `renderPlot()`, etc.  They also now take expressions instead
  of functions.

* Fixed a bug where empty values in a numericInput were sent to the R process
  as 0. They are now sent as NA.

shiny 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix issue #91: bug where downloading files did not work.

* Add [[<- operator for shinyoutput object, making it possible to assign values
  with `output[['plot1']] <- ...`.

* Reactive functions now preserve the visible/invisible state of their returned
  values.

shiny 0.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Reactive functions are now evaluated lazily.

* Add `reactiveValues()`.

* Using `as.list()` to convert a reactivevalues object (like `input`) to a list
  is deprecated. The new function `reactiveValuesToList()` should be used
  instead.

* Add `isolate()`. This function is used for accessing reactive functions,
  without them invalidating their parent contexts.

* Fix issue #58: bug where reactive functions are not re-run when all items in
  a checkboxGroup are unchecked.

* Fix issue #71, where `reactiveTable()` would return blank if the first
  element of a data frame was NA.

* In `plotOutput`, better validation for CSS units when specifying width and
  height.

* `reactivePrint()` no longer displays invisible output.

* `reactiveText()` no longer displays printed output, only the return value
  from a function.

* The `runGitHub()` and `runUrl()` functions have been added, for running
  Shiny apps from GitHub repositories and zip/tar files at remote URLs.

* Fix issue #64, where pressing Enter in a textbox would cause a form to
  submit.

shiny 0.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `runGist` has been updated to use the new download URLs from
  https://gist.github.com.

* Shiny now uses `CairoPNG()` for output, when the Cairo package is available.
  This provides better-looking output on Linux and Windows.

shiny 0.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ignore request variables for routing purposes

shiny 0.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix CRAN warning (assigning to global environment)


shiny 0.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [BREAKING] Modify API of `downloadHandler`: The `content` function now takes
  a file path, not writable connection, as an argument. This makes it much
  easier to work with APIs that only write to file paths, not connections.


shiny 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix subtle name resolution bug--the usual symptom being S4 methods not being
  invoked correctly when called from inside of ui.R or server.R

* Add `includeText`, `includeHTML`, and `includeMarkdown` functions for putting
  text, HTML, and Markdown content from external files in the application's UI.


shiny 0.1.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add `runGist` function for conveniently running a Shiny app that is published
  on gist.github.com.
* Fix issue #27: Warnings cause reactive functions to stop executing.
* The server.R and ui.R filenames are now case insensitive.
* Add `wellPanel` function for creating inset areas on the page.
* Add `bootstrapPage` function for creating new Bootstrap based
  layouts from scratch.


shiny 0.1.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix issue #26: Shiny.OutputBindings not correctly exported.
* Add `repeatable` function for making easily repeatable versions of random
  number generating functions.
* Transcode JSON into UTF-8 (prevents non-ASCII reactivePrint values from
  causing errors on Windows).


shiny 0.1.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Import package dependencies, instead of attaching them (with the exception of
  websockets, which doesn't currently work unless attached).
* conditionalPanel was animated, now it is not.
* bindAll was not correctly sending initial values to the server; fixed.


shiny 0.1.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: JS APIs Shiny.bindInput and Shiny.bindOutput removed and
  replaced with Shiny.bindAll; Shiny.unbindInput and Shiny.unbindOutput removed
  and replaced with Shiny.unbindAll.
* Add file upload support (currently only works with Chrome and Firefox). Use
  a normal HTML file input, or call the `fileInput` UI function.
* Shiny.unbindOutputs did not work, now it does.
* Generally improved robustness of dynamic input/output bindings.
* Add conditionalPanel UI function to allow showing/hiding UI based on a JS
  expression; for example, whether an input is a particular value. Also works in
  raw HTML (add the `data-display-if` attribute to the element that should be
  shown/hidden).
* htmlOutput (CSS class `shiny-html-output`) can contain inputs and outputs.


shiny 0.1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Allow Bootstrap tabsets to act as reactive inputs; their value indicates which
  tab is active
* Upgrade to Bootstrap 2.1
* Add `checkboxGroupInput` control, which presents a list of checkboxes and
  returns a vector of the selected values
* Add `addResourcePath`, intended for reusable component authors to access CSS,
  JavaScript, image files, etc. from their package directories
* Add Shiny.bindInputs(scope), .unbindInputs(scope), .bindOutputs(scope), and
  .unbindOutputs(scope) JS API calls to allow dynamic binding/unbinding of HTML
  elements
