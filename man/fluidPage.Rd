\description{
  Functions for creating fluid page layouts. A fluid layout
  consists of rows which in turn include columns. Rows
  exist for the purpose of making sure their elements
  appear on the same line (if the browser has adequate
  width). Columns exist for the purpose of defining how
  much horizontal space within a 12-unit wide grid it's
  elements should occupy. Fluid pages scale their
  components in realtime to fill all available browser
  width.
}
\details{
  To create a fluid page use the \code{fluidPage} function
  and include instances of \code{fluidRow} and
  \code{\link{column}} within it. As an alternative to
  low-level row and column functions you can also use
  higher-level layout functions like
  \code{\link{sidebarLayout}},
  \code{\link{horizontalLayout}}, or
  \code{\link{columnLayout}}.
