#' Get or set Shiny options
#'
#' `getShinyOption()` retrieves the value of a Shiny option. `shinyOptions()`
#' sets the value of Shiny options; it can also be used to return a list of all
#' currently-set Shiny options.
#'
#' @section Scope:
#' There is a global option set which is available by default. When a Shiny
#' application is run with [runApp()], that option set is duplicated and the
#' new option set is available for getting or setting values. If options
#' are set from `global.R`, `app.R`, `ui.R`, or `server.R`, or if they are set
#' from inside the server function, then the options will be scoped to the
#' application. When the application exits, the new option set is discarded and
#' the global option set is restored.
#'
#' @section Options:
#' There are a number of global options that affect Shiny's behavior. These can
#' be set globally with `options()` or locally (for a single app) with
#' `shinyOptions()`.
#'
#' \describe{
#' \item{shiny.autoreload (defaults to `FALSE`)}{If `TRUE` when a Shiny app is launched, the
#'   app directory will be continually monitored for changes to files that
#'   have the extensions: r, htm, html, js, css, png, jpg, jpeg, gif. If any
#'   changes are detected, all connected Shiny sessions are reloaded. This
#'   allows for fast feedback loops when tweaking Shiny UI.
#'
#'   Since monitoring for changes is expensive (we simply poll for last
#'   modified times), this feature is intended only for development.
#'
#'   You can customize the file patterns Shiny will monitor by setting the
#'   shiny.autoreload.pattern option. For example, to monitor only ui.R:
#'   `options(shiny.autoreload.pattern = glob2rx("ui.R"))`
#'
#'   The default polling interval is 500 milliseconds. You can change this
#'   by setting e.g. `options(shiny.autoreload.interval = 2000)` (every
#'   two seconds).}
#' \item{shiny.deprecation.messages (defaults to `TRUE`)}{This controls whether messages for
#'   deprecated functions in Shiny will be printed. See
#'   [shinyDeprecated()] for more information.}
#' \item{shiny.error (defaults to `NULL`)}{This can be a function which is called when an error
#'   occurs. For example, `options(shiny.error=recover)` will result a
#'   the debugger prompt when an error occurs.}
#' \item{shiny.fullstacktrace (defaults to `FALSE`)}{Controls whether "pretty" (`FALSE`) or full
#'   stack traces (`TRUE`) are dumped to the console when errors occur during Shiny app execution.
#'   Pretty stack traces attempt to only show user-supplied code, but this pruning can't always
#'   be done 100% correctly.}
#' \item{shiny.host (defaults to `"127.0.0.1"`)}{The IP address that Shiny should listen on. See
#'   [runApp()] for more information.}
#' \item{shiny.jquery.version (defaults to `3`)}{The major version of jQuery to use.
#' Currently only values of `3` or `1` are supported. If `1`, then jQuery 1.12.4 is used. If `3`,
#' then jQuery 3.4.1 is used.}
#' \item{shiny.json.digits (defaults to `16`)}{The number of digits to use when converting
#'   numbers to JSON format to send to the client web browser.}
#' \item{shiny.launch.browser (defaults to `interactive()`)}{A boolean which controls the default behavior
#'   when an app is run. See [runApp()] for more information.}
#' \item{shiny.maxRequestSize (defaults to 5MB)}{This is a number which specifies the maximum
#'   web request size, which serves as a size limit for file uploads.}
#' \item{shiny.minified (defaults to `TRUE`)}{By default
#'   Whether or not to include Shiny's JavaScript as a minified (`shiny.min.js`)
#'   or un-minified (`shiny.js`) file. The un-minified version is larger,
#'   but can be helpful for development and debugging.}
#' \item{shiny.port (defaults to a random open port)}{A port number that Shiny will listen on. See
#'   [runApp()] for more information.}
#' \item{shiny.reactlog (defaults to `FALSE`)}{If `TRUE`, enable logging of reactive events,
#'   which can be viewed later with the [reactlogShow()] function.
#'   This incurs a substantial performance penalty and should not be used in
#'   production.}
#' \item{shiny.sanitize.errors (defaults to `FALSE`)}{If `TRUE`, then normal errors (i.e.
#'   errors not wrapped in `safeError`) won't show up in the app; a simple
#'   generic error message is printed instead (the error and strack trace printed
#'   to the console remain unchanged). If you want to sanitize errors in general, but you DO want a
#'   particular error `e` to get displayed to the user, then set this option
#'   to `TRUE` and use `stop(safeError(e))` for errors you want the
#'   user to see.}
#' \item{shiny.stacktraceoffset (defaults to `TRUE`)}{If `TRUE`, then Shiny's printed stack
#'   traces will display srcrefs one line above their usual location. This is
#'   an arguably more intuitive arrangement for casual R users, as the name
#'   of a function appears next to the srcref where it is defined, rather than
#'   where it is currently being called from.}
#' \item{shiny.suppressMissingContextError (defaults to `FALSE`)}{Normally, invoking a reactive
#'   outside of a reactive context (or [isolate()]) results in
#'   an error. If this is `TRUE`, don't error in these cases. This
#'   should only be used for debugging or demonstrations of reactivity at the
#'   console.}
#' \item{shiny.testmode (defaults to `FALSE`)}{If `TRUE`, then various features for testing Shiny
#'   applications are enabled.}
#' \item{shiny.trace (defaults to `FALSE`)}{Print messages sent between the R server and the web
#'   browser client to the R console. This is useful for debugging. Possible
#'   values are `"send"` (only print messages sent to the client),
#'   `"recv"` (only print messages received by the server), `TRUE`
#'   (print all messages), or `FALSE` (default; don't print any of these
#'   messages).}
#' \item{shiny.usecairo (defaults to `TRUE`)}{This is used to disable graphical rendering by the
#'   Cairo package, if it is installed. See [plotPNG()] for more
#'   information.}
