## Sending Images

When you want to have R generate a plot and send it to the client browser, the `renderPlot()` function will in most cases do the job. But when you need finer control over the process, you might need to use the `renderImage()` function instead.

### About renderPlot()

`renderPlot()` is useful for any time where R generates an image using its normal graphical device system. In other words, any plot-generating code that would normally go between `png()` and `dev.off()` can be used in `renderPlot()`. If the following code works from the console, then it should work in `renderPlot()`:

{% highlight r %}
png()
# Your plotting code here
dev.off()
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
# This would go in shinyServer()
output$myPlot <- renderPlot({
  # Your plotting code here
})
{% endhighlight %}

`renderPlot()` takes care of a number of details automatically: it will resize the image to fit the output window, and it will even increase the resolution of the output image when displaying on high-resolution ("Retina") screens.

The limitation to `renderPlot()` is that it won't send just any image file to the browser -- the image must be generated by code that uses R's graphical output device system. Other methods of creating images can't be sent by `renderPlot()`. For example, the following won't work:

* Image files generated by the `writePNG()` function from the png package.
* Image files generated by the `rgl.snapshot()` function, which creates images from 3D plots made with the rgl package.
* Images generated by an external program.
* Pre-rendered images.

The solution in these cases is the `renderImage()` function.


### Using renderImage()

Image files can be sent using `renderImage()`. The expression that you pass to `renderImage()` must return a list containing an element named `src`, which is the path to the file. Here is a very basic example of a Shiny app with an output that generates a plot and sends it with `renderImage()`:

#### server.R

{% highlight r %}
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  output$myImage <- renderImage({
    # A temp file to save the output.
    # This file will be removed later by renderImage
    outfile <- tempfile(fileext='.png')

    # Generate the PNG
    png(outfile, width=400, height=300)
    hist(rnorm(input$obs), main="Generated in renderImage()")
    dev.off()

    # Return a list containing the filename
    list(src = outfile,
         contentType = 'image/png',
         width = 400,
         height = 300,
         alt = "This is alternate text")
  }, deleteFile = TRUE)
})
{% endhighlight %}

#### ui.r

{% highlight r %}
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("renderImage example"),
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
                min = 0, max = 1000,  value = 500)
  ),
  mainPanel(
    # Use imageOutput to place the image on the page
    imageOutput("myImage")
  )
))
{% endhighlight %}


Each time this output object is re-executed, it creates a new PNG file, saves a plot to it, then returns a list containing the filename along with some other values.

Because the `deleteFile` argument is `TRUE`, Shiny will delete the file (specified by the `src` element) after it sends the data. This is appropriate for a case like this, where the image is created on-the-fly, but it wouldn't be appropriate when, for example, your app sends pre-rendered images.

In this particular case, the image file is created with the `png()` function. But it just as well could have been created with `writePNG()` from the png package, or by any other method. If you have the filename of the image, you can send it with `renderImage()`.

#### Structure of the returned list

The list returned in the example above contains the following:

* `src`: The output file path.
* `contentType`: The MIME type of the file. If this is missing, Shiny will try to autodetect the MIME type, from the file extension.
* `width` and `height`: The desired output size, in pixels.
* `alt`: Alternate text for the image.

Except for `src` and `contentType`, all values are passed through directly to the `<img>` DOM element on the web page. The effect is similar to having an image tag with the following:

{% highlight xml %}
<img src="..." width="400" height="300" alt="This is alternate text">
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the `src="..."` is shorthand for a longer URL. For browsers that support the [data URI scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme), the `src` and `contentType` from the returned list are put together to create a special URL that embeds the data, so the result would be similar to something like this:

{% highlight xml %}
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAm0AAAGnCAYAAADlkGDxAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAgAElEQVR4nOydd3ic1ZX/P2+ZKmlU" 
  width="400" height="300" alt="This is alternate text">
{% endhighlight %}

For browsers that don't support the data URI scheme, Shiny sends a URL that points to the file.


### Sending pre-rendered images with renderImage()

If your Shiny app has pre-rendered images saved in a subdirectory, you can send them using `renderImage()`. Suppose the images are in the subdirectory `images/`, and are named `image1.jpeg`, `image2.jpeg`, and so on. The following code would send the appropriate image, depending on the value of `input$n`:

#### server.R

{% highlight r %}
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  # Send a pre-rendered image, and don't delete the image after sending it
  output$preImage <- renderImage({
    # When input$n is 3, filename is ./images/image3.jpeg
    filename <- normalizePath(file.path('./images',
                              paste('image', input$n, '.jpeg', sep='')))
 
    # Return a list containing the filename and alt text
    list(src = filename,
         alt = paste("Image number", input$n))

  }, deleteFile = FALSE)
})
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `deleteFile` is `FALSE` because the images aren't ephemeral; we don't want Shiny to delete an image after sending it.

Note that this might be less efficient than putting images in `www/images` and emitting HTML that points to the images, because in the latter case the image will be cached by the browser.


### Using clientData values

In the first example above, the plot size was fixed at 400 by 300 pixels. For dynamic resizing, it's possible to use values from `session$clientData` to detect the output size.

In the example below, the output object is `output$myImage`, and the width and height on the client browser are sent via `session$clientData$output_myImage_width` and `session$clientData$output_myImage_height`. This example also uses `session$clientData$pixelratio` to multiply the resolution of the image, so that it appears sharp on high-resolution (Retina) displays:

#### server.R

{% highlight r %}
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {

  # A dynamically-sized plot
  output$myImage <- renderImage({
    # Read myImage's width and height. These are reactive values, so this
    # expression will re-run whenever they change.
    width  <- session$clientData$output_myImage_width
    height <- session$clientData$output_myImage_height

    # For high-res displays, this will be greater than 1
    pixelratio <- session$clientData$pixelratio

    # A temp file to save the output.
    outfile <- tempfile(fileext='.png')

    # Generate the image file
    png(outfile, width=width*pixelratio, height=height*pixelratio,
        res=72*pixelratio)
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
    dev.off()

    # Return a list containing the filename
    list(src = outfile,
         width = width,
         height = height,
         alt = "This is alternate text")
  }, deleteFile = TRUE)

  # This code reimplements many of the features of `renderPlot()`.
  # The effect of this code is very similar to:
  # renderPlot({
  #   hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  # })
})
{% endhighlight %}

The `width` and `height` values passed to `png()` specify the pixel dimensions of the saved image. These can differ from the `width` and `height` values in the returned list: those values are the pixel dimensions to used display the image. For high-res displays (where `pixelratio` is 2), a "virtual" pixel in the browser might correspond to 2 x 2 physical pixels, and a double-resolution image will make use of each of the physical pixels.
