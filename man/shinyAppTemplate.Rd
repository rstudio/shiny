\title{Generate a Shiny application from a template}
\usage{
shinyAppTemplate(path = NULL, examples = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to create new shiny application template.}

\item{examples}{Either one of "default", "ask", "all", or any combination of
"app", "rdir", "module", "shinytest", "testthat", and "server". In an
interactive session, "default" falls back to "ask"; in a non-interactive
session, "default" falls back to "all". With "ask", this function will
prompt the user to select which template items will be added to the new app
directory. With "all", all template items will be added to the app
directory.}
}
\description{
This function populates a directory with files for a Shiny application.
}
\details{
In an interactive R session, this function will, by default, prompt the user
which components to add to the application.

The full example application includes the following files and directories:\preformatted{appdir/
|- app.R
|- R
|   |- my-module.R
|   |- sort.R
`-- tests
    |- server.R
    |- server
    |   |- test-mymodule.R
    |   `- test-server.R
    |- shinytest.R
    |- shinytest
    |   `- mytest.R
    |- testthat.R
    `-- testthat
        |- helper-load.R
        `- test-sort.R
}

Some notes about these files:
\itemize{
\item \code{app.R} is the main application file.
\item All files in the \verb{R/} subdirectory are automatically sourced when the
application is run.
\item \code{R/sort.R} and \code{R/my-module.R} are automatically sourced when
the application is run. The first contains a function \code{lexical_sort()},
and the second contains code for a \href{moduleServer()}{Shiny module} which
is used in the application.
\item \verb{tests/} contains various tests for the application. You may
choose to use or remove any of them. They can be executed by the
\code{\link[=runTests]{runTests()}} function.
\item \code{tests/server.R} is a test runner for test files in
\verb{tests/server/}.
\item \code{tests/server/test-mymodule.R} is a test for the module.
\item \code{tests/shinytest.R} is a test runner for test files in the
\verb{tests/shinytest/} directory.
\item \code{tests/shinytest/mytest.R} is a test that uses the
\href{https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/}{shinytest} package to do
snapshot-based testing.
\item \code{tests/testthat.R} is a test runner for test files in the
\verb{tests/testthat/} directory.
\item \code{tests/testthat/helper-load.R} is a helper script that is automatically
loaded before running \code{test-mymodule.}R. (This is performed by the testthat
package.)
\item \code{tests/testthat/test-sort.R} is a set of tests that use the
\href{https://testthat.r-lib.org/}{testthat} package for testing.
