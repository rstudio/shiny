shiny 0.4.1.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* License for Shiny changed to GPL >= 2, and a few files are dual-licensed
  under the GPL >= 2 and BSD 3-clause.

* New method for detecting hidden output objects. Instead of checking that
  height and width are 0, it checks that the object or any ancestor in the DOM
  has style display:none.

* Add `clientData` reactive values object, which carries information about the
  client. This includes the hidden status of output objects, height/width plot
  output objects, and the URL of the browser.

* Add `parseQueryString()` function.

* Add `renderImage()` function for sending arbitrary image files to the client,
  and its counterpart, `imageOutput()`.

* Add support for high-resolution (Retina) displays.

* Fix bug #55, where `renderTable()` would throw error with an empty data frame.

shiny 0.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix bug where width and height weren't passed along properly from
  `reactivePlot` to `renderPlot`.

* Fix bug where infinite recursion would happen when `reactivePlot` was passed
  a function for width or height.

shiny 0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added suspend/resume capability to observers.

* Output objects are automatically suspended when they are hidden on the user's
  web browser.

* `runGist()` accepts GitHub's new URL format, which includes the username.

* `reactive()` and `observe()` now take expressions instead of functions.

* `reactiveText()`, `reactivePlot()`, and so on, have been renamed to
  `renderText()`, `renderPlot()`, etc.  They also now take expressions instead
  of functions.

* Fixed a bug where empty values in a numericInput were sent to the R process
  as 0. They are now sent as NA.

shiny 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix issue #91: bug where downloading files did not work.

* Add [[<- operator for shinyoutput object, making it possible to assign values
  with `output[['plot1']] <- ...`.

* Reactive functions now preserve the visible/invisible state of their returned
  values.

shiny 0.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Reactive functions are now evaluated lazily.

* Add `reactiveValues()`.

* Using `as.list()` to convert a reactivevalues object (like `input`) to a list
  is deprecated. The new function `reactiveValuesToList()` should be used
  instead.

* Add `isolate()`. This function is used for accessing reactive functions,
  without them invalidating their parent contexts.

* Fix issue #58: bug where reactive functions are not re-run when all items in
  a checkboxGroup are unchecked.

* Fix issue #71, where `reactiveTable()` would return blank if the first
  element of a data frame was NA.

* In `plotOutput`, better validation for CSS units when specifying width and
  height.

* `reactivePrint()` no longer displays invisible output.

* `reactiveText()` no longer displays printed output, only the return value
  from a function.

* The `runGitHub()` and `runUrl()` functions have been added, for running
  Shiny apps from GitHub repositories and zip/tar files at remote URLs.

* Fix issue #64, where pressing Enter in a textbox would cause a form to
  submit.

shiny 0.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `runGist` has been updated to use the new download URLs from
  https://gist.github.com.

* Shiny now uses `CairoPNG()` for output, when the Cairo package is available.
  This provides better-looking output on Linux and Windows.

shiny 0.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ignore request variables for routing purposes

shiny 0.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix CRAN warning (assigning to global environment)


shiny 0.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [BREAKING] Modify API of `downloadHandler`: The `content` function now takes
  a file path, not writable connection, as an argument. This makes it much
  easier to work with APIs that only write to file paths, not connections.


shiny 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix subtle name resolution bug--the usual symptom being S4 methods not being
  invoked correctly when called from inside of ui.R or server.R


shiny 0.1.14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix slider animator, which broke in 0.1.10


shiny 0.1.13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix temp file leak in reactivePlot


shiny 0.1.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix problems with runGist on Windows
* Add feature for on-the-fly file downloads (e.g. CSV data, PDFs)
* Add CSS hooks for app-wide busy indicators


shiny 0.1.11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix input binding with IE8 on Shiny Server
* Fix issue #41: reactiveTable should allow print options too
* Allow dynamic sizing of reactivePlot (i.e. using a function instead of a fixed
  value)


shiny 0.1.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support more MIME types when serving out of www
* Fix issue #35: Allow modification of untar args
* headerPanel can take an explicit window title parameter
* checkboxInput uses correct attribute `checked` instead of `selected`
* Fix plot rendering with IE8 on Shiny Server


shiny 0.1.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Much less flicker when updating plots
* More customizable error display
* Add `includeText`, `includeHTML`, and `includeMarkdown` functions for putting
  text, HTML, and Markdown content from external files in the application's UI.


shiny 0.1.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add `runGist` function for conveniently running a Shiny app that is published
  on gist.github.com.
* Fix issue #27: Warnings cause reactive functions to stop executing.
* The server.R and ui.R filenames are now case insensitive.
* Add `wellPanel` function for creating inset areas on the page.
* Add `bootstrapPage` function for creating new Twitter Bootstrap based
  layouts from scratch.


shiny 0.1.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix issue #26: Shiny.OutputBindings not correctly exported.
* Add `repeatable` function for making easily repeatable versions of random
  number generating functions.
* Transcode JSON into UTF-8 (prevents non-ASCII reactivePrint values from
  causing errors on Windows).


shiny 0.1.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Import package dependencies, instead of attaching them (with the exception of
  websockets, which doesn't currently work unless attached).
* conditionalPanel was animated, now it is not.
* bindAll was not correctly sending initial values to the server; fixed.


shiny 0.1.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: JS APIs Shiny.bindInput and Shiny.bindOutput removed and
  replaced with Shiny.bindAll; Shiny.unbindInput and Shiny.unbindOutput removed
  and replaced with Shiny.unbindAll.
* Add file upload support (currently only works with Chrome and Firefox). Use
  a normal HTML file input, or call the `fileInput` UI function.
* Shiny.unbindOutputs did not work, now it does.
* Generally improved robustness of dynamic input/output bindings.
* Add conditionalPanel UI function to allow showing/hiding UI based on a JS
  expression; for example, whether an input is a particular value. Also works in
  raw HTML (add the `data-display-if` attribute to the element that should be
  shown/hidden).
* htmlOutput (CSS class `shiny-html-output`) can contain inputs and outputs.


shiny 0.1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Allow Bootstrap tabsets to act as reactive inputs; their value indicates which
  tab is active
* Upgrade to Bootstrap 2.1
* Add `checkboxGroupInput` control, which presents a list of checkboxes and
  returns a vector of the selected values
* Add `addResourcePath`, intended for reusable component authors to access CSS,
  JavaScript, image files, etc. from their package directories
* Add Shiny.bindInputs(scope), .unbindInputs(scope), .bindOutputs(scope), and
  .unbindOutputs(scope) JS API calls to allow dynamic binding/unbinding of HTML
  elements

  creating custom input controls
* Add `step` parameter to numericInput
