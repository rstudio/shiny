\description{
Historically this function was used in ui.R files to register a user
interface with Shiny. It is no longer required as of Shiny 0.10; simply
ensure that the last expression to be returned from ui.R is a user interface.
This function is kept for backwards compatibility with older applications. It
returns the value that is passed to it.
