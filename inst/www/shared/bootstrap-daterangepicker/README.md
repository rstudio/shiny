# Date Range Picker for Twitter Bootstrap

![Improvely.com](http://i.imgur.com/LbAMf3D.png)

This date range picker component for Twitter Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can 
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

If invoked with no options, it will present two calendars to choose a start 
and end date from. Optionally, you can provide a list of date ranges the user can select from instead 
of choosing dates from the calendars. If attached to a text input, the selected dates will be inserted 
into the text box. Otherwise, you can provide a custom callback function to receive the selection.

## Usage

This component relies on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), 
[Datejs](http://www.datejs.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

Basic usage:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="date.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="daterangepicker.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="daterangepicker.css" />

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker();
});
</script>
```

Additional options allow:
* Custom callback handler called when the date range selection is made
* Setting initial start and end dates for the calendars
* Overriding all labels in the interface with localized text
* Bounding the minimum and maximum selectable dates
* Starting the calendar week on any day of week
* Overriding the direction the dropdown expands (left/right of element it's attached to)
* Setting the date format string for parsing and printing dates
* Showing week numbers
* Maximum selectable range (i.e. 3 days, 1 week, 12 months)
* Month and year dropdowns

Syntax for all the options can be found in the examples.html file.
