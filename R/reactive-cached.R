#' Create a reactive expression with caching
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Ordinary [reactive()] expressions will cache their most recent value. This
#' can make computation more efficient, because time-consuming code can execute
#' once and the result can be used in multiple different places without needing
#' to re-execute the code.
#'
#' With `cachedReactive()`, any number of previous values can be cached. The
#' most important difference in using `cachedReactive()` is that you must
#' provide `key`, which is an expression that generates as a _cache key_, in
#' addition to `value`, which is an expression that generates the value returned
#' by the `cachedReactive()`.
#'
#' For each possible value returned by `key`, there should be one possible value
#' returned by `value`; a given value of `key` should not correspond to multiple
#' possible values of `value`.
#'
#' The way to use this is to have a `key` that is fast to compute, and a `value`
#' that is expensive to compute.  To see if `value` should be computed,
#' `cachedReactive()` evaluates `key` and then serializes and hashes the result.
#' If the resulting hashed key is in the cache, then `cachedReactive()` simply
#' retrieves the previously calculated value and returns it; if not, then the
#' `value` is computed and the result is stored in the cache before being
#' returned.
#'
#' The `key` should be fast to compute, and ideally it will return an object
#' that is not too large, since the object must be serialized and hashed.
#' Typically, `key` will use any reactive inputs that are used by `value`, but
#' will do something that is fast and simple with them, like put them together
#' in a list. It is also best to use non-reference objects, since the
#' serialization of these objects may not capture relevant changes.
#'
#' `cachedReactive()` also can take an `event` so that it behaves similar to
#' [eventReactive()]. See more in the **Event expression** section.
#'
#' @section Cache keys and reactivity:
#'
#'   Because the value from `value` is cached, it is not necessarily
#'   re-executed, and therefore it can't be used to decide what objects to take
#'   reactive dependencies on. Instead, the `key` is used to figure out which
#'   objects to take reactive dependencies on. In short, the `key` is reactive,
#'   and `value` is not (it is run inside of [isolate()]).
#'
#'   Here's an example of what not to do: if `key={input$x}` and `value={input$x
#'   + input$y}`, then it will only take a reactive dependency on `input$x` --
#'   it won't recompute `value` when `input$y` changes. Moreover, the cache
#'   won't use `input$y` as part of the key, and so it could return incorrect
#'   values in the future when it retrieves values from the cache. (See the
#'   examples below for an example of this.)
#'
#'   A better cache key would be something like `list(input$x, input$y)`. This
#'   does two things: it ensures that a reactive dependency is taken on both `x`
#'   and `y`, and it also makes sure that both values are represented in the
#'   cache key.
#'
#'   In general, `key` should use the same reactive inputs as `value`, but the
#'   computation should be simpler. If there are other (non-reactive) values
#'   that are consumed, such as external data sources, they should be used in
#'   the `key` as well. Note that if the `key` is large, it can make sense to do
#'   some sort of reduction on it so that the serialization and hashing of the
#'   cache key is not too expensive.
#'
#'   Remember that the `key` is _reactive_, so it is not re-executed every
#'   single time that someone accesses the `cachedReactive`. For example,
#'   suppose we have this `cachedReactive`:
#'
#'   ```
#'   r <- cachedReactive(
#'     key = { list(input$x, input$y) },
#'     value = { input$x + input$y }
#'   )
#'   ```
#'
#' The first time someone calls `r()`, it executes both `key` and `value`. If
#' someone calls `r()` again, then it does not need to re-execute `key`, because
#' that `expr` has not been invalidated via a change to `input$x` or `input$y`;
#' it simply returns the previous value. However, if `input$x` or `input$y`
#' changes, then the reactive expression will be invalidated, and the next time
#' that someone calls `r()`, `key` will need to be re-executed.
#'
#'
#' @section Event expressions and reactivity:
#'
#'   Typically, the `key` expression is reactive (the `value` is never reactive,
#'   as it is run inside of [isolate()]). However, there are times when it's not
#'   ideal for `key` to be reactive: perhaps you have [sliderInput]s `x` and `y`,
#'   but you don't want the computation to occur until the user sets both `x`
#'   and `y`, and then clicks on an [actionButton] named `go`.
#'
#'   The value of `input$go` shouldn't be included in the cache key, because its
#'   value is not relevant to the calculation involving `input$x` and `input$y`.
#'   You also don't want to take a reactive dependency on `input$x` and
#'   `input$y`, because then any changes to those values would cause this cached
#'   reactive to do the computation or fetch the value from the cache and return
#'   it.
#'
#'   In short, in this case, you want to take a reactive dependency on
#'   `input$go` and not use its value for the cache key, and you want to **not**
#'   take a reactive dependency on `input$x` and `input$y` but use those values
#'   for the cache key.
#'
#'   This can be done by using `event`, similar to in the [eventReactive()]
#'   function. If a non-NULL `event` is provided to `cachedReactive()`, then it
#'   will be used for the reactive dependencies but its value will be ignored,
#'   and the `key` will be used for its value, but it will be executed in an
#'   [isolate()], so it will not be used for its reactive dependencies.
#'
#'   In the example described above, you would use something like:
#'
#'
#'   ```
#'   r <- cachedReactive(
#'     event = { input$go },
#'     key = { list(input$x, input$y) },
#'     value = { input$x + input$y }
#'   )
#'   ```
#'
#' @section Async with cached reactives:
#'
#'   With a cached reactive expression, the key and/or value expression can be
#'   _asynchronous_. In other words, they can be promises -- not regular R
#'   promises, but rather objects provided by the \pkg{promises}  package, which
#'   are similar to promises in JavaScript. (See [promises::promise()] for more
#'   information.) You can also use [future::future()] objects to run code in a
#'   separate process or even on a remote machine.
#'
#'   If `value` is a promise, then anything that consumes the `cachedReactive`
#'   must expect it to return a promise.
#'
#'   Similarly, if `key` or `event` is a promise (in other words, if they are
#'   asynchronous), then the entire `cachedReactive` must be asynchronous, since
#'   the key must be computed before `value` is evaluated (or the value is
#'   retrieved from the cache). Anything that consumes the `cachedReactive` must
#'   therefore expect it to return a promise.
#'
#' @section Cache key internals:
#'
#' The actual cache key that is used internally takes value from evaluating
#' `key` and combines it with the (unevaluated) _body_ of the `value`
#' expression.
#'
#' This means that if there are two `cachedReactive`s which use the same value
#' from evaluating `key`, but different `value` expressions, then they will not
#' need to worry about collisions.
#'
#' However, if two `cachedReactive`s have the identical `key` and `value`
#' expressions, they will share the cached values. This is useful when using
#' `cache="app"`: there may be multiple user sessions which create separate
#' `cachedReactive` objects (by executing the server function multiple times),
#' and those `cachedReactive` objects across sessions can share values in the
#' cache.
#'
#' @inheritParams reactive
#' @param key An expression or quosure that returns a value that will be hashed
#'   and used as a cache key. This key should be a unique identifier for the
#'   value: the assumption is that if the cache key is the same, then the value
#'   of `expr` is the same. If two separate `cachedReactive`s have the same key,
#'   the value is assumed to be the same. To avoid this, you can add an
#'   arbitrary identifier (like an ID string) to the cache key.
#' @param value The expression or quosure that produces the return value of the
#'   `cachedReactive`. It will be executed within an [isolate()] scope.
#' @param event An optional expression or quosure used for reactivity. If
#'   non-NULL, then `event` will be evaluated in a reactive context, and both
#'   `key` and `value` will be evaluated in an [isolate()] scope (and will not
#'   be used for reactive dependencies).
#' @param ignoreNULL If `TRUE`, then if `event` evaluates to `NULL`, then a
#'   silent exception will be raised and the cache key and the value will not be
#'   computed. See [req()] for more on silent exceptions.
#' @param cache The scope of the cache, or a cache object. This can be `"app"`
#'   (the default), `"session"`, or a cache object like a
#'   [cachem::cache_disk()]. See the Cache Scoping section for more information.
#' @param ... Other arguments are ignored.
