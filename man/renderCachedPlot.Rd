\arguments{
\item{expr}{An expression that generates a plot.}

\item{cacheKeyExpr}{An expression that returns a cache key. This key should
be a unique identifier for a plot: the assumption is that if the cache key
is the same, then the plot will be the same.}

\item{sizePolicy}{A function that takes two arguments, \code{width} and
\code{height}, and returns a list with \code{width} and \code{height}. The
purpose is to round the actual pixel dimensions from the browser to some
other dimensions, so that this will not generate and cache images of every
possible pixel dimension. See \code{\link[=sizeGrowthRatio]{sizeGrowthRatio()}} for more
information on the default sizing policy.}

\item{res}{The resolution of the PNG, in pixels per inch.}

\item{cache}{The scope of the cache, or a cache object. This can be \code{"app"}
(the default), \code{"session"}, or a cache object like a
\code{\link[cachem:cache_disk]{cachem::cache_disk()}}. See the Cache Scoping section for more information.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed through to \code{\link[grDevices:png]{grDevices::png()}}.
These can be used to set the width, height, background color, etc.}

\item{alt}{Alternate text for the HTML \verb{<img>} tag
if it cannot be displayed or viewed (i.e., the user uses a screen reader).
In addition to a character string, the value may be a reactive expression
(or a function referencing reactive values) that returns a character string.
NULL or "" is not recommended because those should be limited to decorative images
(the default is "Plot object").}

\item{outputArgs}{A list of arguments to be passed through to the implicit
call to \code{\link[=plotOutput]{plotOutput()}} when \code{renderPlot} is used in an
interactive R Markdown document.}

\item{width, height}{not used. They are specified via the argument
\code{sizePolicy}.}
}
\description{
Renders a reactive plot, with plot images cached to disk. As of Shiny 1.6.0,
this is a shortcut for using \code{\link[=bindCache]{bindCache()}} with \code{\link[=renderPlot]{renderPlot()}}.
}
\details{
\code{expr} is an expression that generates a plot, similar to that in
\code{renderPlot}. Unlike with \code{renderPlot}, this expression does not
take reactive dependencies. It is re-executed only when the cache key
changes.

\code{cacheKeyExpr} is an expression which, when evaluated, returns an object
which will be serialized and hashed using the \code{\link[rlang:hash]{rlang::hash()}}
function to generate a string that will be used as a cache key. This key is
used to identify the contents of the plot: if the cache key is the same as a
previous time, it assumes that the plot is the same and can be retrieved from
the cache.

This \code{cacheKeyExpr} is reactive, and so it will be re-evaluated when any
upstream reactives are invalidated. This will also trigger re-execution of
the plotting expression, \code{expr}.

The key should consist of "normal" R objects, like vectors and lists. Lists
should in turn contain other normal R objects. If the key contains
environments, external pointers, or reference objects --- or even if it has
such objects attached as attributes --- then it is possible that it will
change unpredictably even when you do not expect it to. Additionally, because
the entire key is serialized and hashed, if it contains a very large object
--- a large data set, for example --- there may be a noticeable performance
penalty.

If you face these issues with the cache key, you can work around them by
extracting out the important parts of the objects, and/or by converting them
to normal R objects before returning them. Your expression could even
serialize and hash that information in an efficient way and return a string,
which will in turn be hashed (very quickly) by the
\code{\link[rlang:hash]{rlang::hash()}} function.

Internally, the result from \code{cacheKeyExpr} is combined with the name of
the output (if you assign it to \code{output$plot1}, it will be combined
with \code{"plot1"}) to form the actual key that is used. As a result, even
if there are multiple plots that have the same \code{cacheKeyExpr}, they
will not have cache key collisions.

\section{Interactive plots}{


\code{renderCachedPlot} can be used to create interactive plots. See
\code{\link[=plotOutput]{plotOutput()}} for more information and examples.

See \code{\link[=renderPlot]{renderPlot()}} for the regular, non-cached version of this
function. It can be used with \code{\link[=bindCache]{bindCache()}} to get the same effect as
\code{renderCachedPlot()}. For more about configuring caches, see
