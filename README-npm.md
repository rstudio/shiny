@posit/shiny
============

This npm package contains TypeScript type definitions for Shiny's client-side JavaScript libraries.

It does not include the Shiny framework itself, though that may change in the future.

[Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) is a web application framework for both R and Python, developed by Posit PBC.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @posit/shiny
```
